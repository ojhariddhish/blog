I'm a freelancer Android developer from Mumbai, India. I've always been fascinated about technology, its role in our lives
and how it simplifies our life further. I invest my free time doing research online about technologies and fringe sciences.
I want to use this website to share my research, knowledge and skills I've acquired over the years.

Learn more about me at [my website](https://ojhariddhish.github.io).
